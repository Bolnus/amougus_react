# Amogus mini game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). \
The project consists of backend node express and frontend react single page applications. 

## Deploy

Packages in `node_modules` directory are git ignored, so you need to run `npm install` for both applications. \
Backend `node_modules` are in the project directory and frontend `node_modules` are in `frontend/` directory. 

## Run

In the project directory execute:

### `npm start`

to run backend application.\
To run frontend application move to `frontend/` in a different console and execute: 

### `npm start`

there. Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) to view it in your browser.
